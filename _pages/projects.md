Decay is a utility meant to be used for Github-based documentation.  In an environment where there are no dedicated documentation writers but a need to maintain some simblance of up-to-date documentation it would be nice to have a tool that is watching for stale documentation and sending you reports or even updating the code to indicate when it has gone stale.  Decay does that and has a lot of options to ensure that it's only as intrusive as you want it to be.
